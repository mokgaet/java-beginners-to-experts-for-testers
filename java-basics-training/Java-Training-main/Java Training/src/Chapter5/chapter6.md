# Arrays

## Difference between array initialisation
`int[] arr = {2, 5};` 
**AND** 
`int[] arr = new int[] {2, 5};`

> The difference between int[] arr = new int[] {2, 5}; and int[] arr = {2, 5}; is purely syntactical and does not affect memory usage. 

>Both forms allocate the same memory for the array object and its elements.
